# MCP39
MCP39 is heavily based on Bitcoins [BIP39] but due to drastic changes from the hashing algorithms we changed the internal name to MCP39.
BIP39 uses SHA256 and SHA512 aswell as SHA512-KMAC to provide the functionality of hashing and getting corresponding Mnemoniac seeds.
MCP39 uses SHA3-256 and SHA3-KMAC instead, changing the output completely and thus the renaming was necessary.

The functionality of MCP39 is the same as BIP39, please refer to [BIP39] for further documentation.

There is still plenty of code from the BIP39 in the MCP39, all credit belongs to those who developed it and are mentioned in the headers copyright.
