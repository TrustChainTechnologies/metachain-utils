# Installation

#### Using binaries
Binaries are currently provided for windows only. Please have a look at the /bin/ folder.
#### Dependencies
Every util might have a different dependency, which will be listed in their project folders.
All projects have the following requirements and dependencies:
- for compiling from source you'll need a working [boost] installation with all libraries built.
- C++ compiler needs to have C++11 compability. As soon as C++17.2 is available, changes will be made to use the C++17.2 standard as dependency!
#### Building for source on windows
- clone the git repository using github for Desktop
- place all dependencies in a folder named "dependencies" in the project root. clone the corresponding git repositories of the dependencies into this folder
- open the MetaChain-Utils.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio
- build for Debug or Release
#### Building for source on linux
currently not supported
